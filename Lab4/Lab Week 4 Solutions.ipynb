    ">On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",

    "Usually, this step goes hand in hand with the EDA. However, as EDA is not a focus of this module let us assume the following assumptions that have been determined by the EDA (some of them have been changed for this lab and may not directly correlate with the actual data though):\n",
    "- A majority of survivors were female\n",
    "- The *Name* column has further information including titles\n",
    "- The *PassengerID*, *Ticket* and *Cabin* have low correlations with other variables and can be removed\n",
    "- Missing values are in the *Age*, *Cabin* and *Embarked* column\n",
    "- The *Pclass* variable has a high correlation with the *Age* variable\n",
    "- The *Fare* is higher, the higher the *Pclass*'s\n",
    "- The *Fare* has some outliers with some extreme pricey tickets\n",
    "- *SibSp* and *Parch* do not have a high correlation with other variables but could be combined to obtain a family size\n",
    "- Passengers in cabins in the *pclass* had higher survival rates\n",
    "- There are only a few older passengers based on the *Age* variable\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Remove unnecessary columns\n",
    "2. Handle missing values\n",

    "4. Handle the *Age* variable \n",

    "The EDA has shown that there are only a few older passengers based on the *Age* variable.\n",

    "we may only be interested in whether it rained on a particular day. Given the\n",
    "precipitation values, we can binarize the values, so that we get a true value if the\n",
    "precipitation value isn't zero, and a false value otherwise. We can also use statistics\n",
    "to divide values into high, low, and medium bins. In marketing, we often care more\n",
    "about the age group, such as 18 to 24, than a specific age, such as 23.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The binning process inevitably leads to loss of information. However, depending on\n",
    "your goals, this may not be an issue, and actually reduces the chance of overfitting.\n",
    "Certainly, there will be improvements in speed and reduction of memory or storage\n",
    "requirements and redundancy.\n",

This gives you an option to determine the performance of a model and then change some model settings such as hyperparameters, retrain the train set and observe the performance again. Whilst the data from the validation set does not directly affect the training, this dataset becomes more biased the more you use it to tune the model which can still lead to some kind of overfitting. \n",

A good guideline is to look at what others have done with a specific dataset, like looking at scientific papers that also use this data. The common starting point is usually an 70/0/30 or 80/0/20 split for train/val/test if you do not want to use a validation set, or 70/10/20 if you use a validation set. \n",

    "Here is where the PassengerId value, which we have not yet removed, comes into play. It nicely visualises that a basic split using standard indexing *may not be the best solution*. You can see that, even though the data was split the **first** 80% of passengers are in the train set. Optimally you would want to avoid any kind of ordering in the train/val/test data as there may be some bias attached to it, for example, that the first bit of tickets was only sold to people that reside in cabins that had a higher chance of survival (Note: Using EDA as taught in the SDfDS module could confirm that assumption, but we are focusing on data preparation in this module). \n",

Therefore, using a random see leads to repeatable results. \n",
