    ">On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",

    "Usually, this step goes hand in hand with the EDA. However, as EDA is not a focus of this module let us assume the following assumptions that have been determined by the EDA (some of them have been changed for this lab and may not directly correlate with the actual data though):\n",
    "- A majority of survivors were female\n",
    "- The *Name* column has further information including titles\n",
    "- The *PassengerID*, *Ticket* and *Cabin* have low correlations with other variables and can be removed\n",
    "- Missing values are in the *Age*, *Cabin* and *Embarked* column\n",
    "- The *Pclass* variable has a high correlation with the *Age* variable\n",
    "- The *Fare* is higher, the higher the *Pclass*'s\n",
    "- The *Fare* has some outliers with some extreme pricey tickets\n",
    "- *SibSp* and *Parch* do not have a high correlation with other variables but could be combined to obtain a family size\n",
    "- Passengers in cabins in the *pclass* had higher survival rates\n",
    "- There are only a few older passengers based on the *Age* variable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, based on the EDA, we want to perform the following:\n",
    "1. Remove unnecessary columns\n",
    "2. Handle missing values\n",
    "3. Engineer features that utilize title within *name*\n",
    "4. Handle the *Age* variable \n",
    "5. Handle the *Fare* variable\n",
    "6. Handle the *SibSp* and *Parch* values to create a family size. \n",
    "7. Encode the data\n",

    "This is not an exclusive list of steps but shows the most common steps in this stage of an ML pipeline. Often there are more variables and further insights with an EDA which require more feature extraction and engineering as well as data preparation steps. \n",

First, because we have a few older people who could skew the mean and second, because we have the high correlation as described.
